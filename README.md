## \_vbXML 0\.04\_


</div>

### Description

vbXML 0.04 is here, finally. This is a relativeley quick release, not counting the months since the last release :-). I am sorry for my lack of updates, but here is what I have recently added: Functions accepting arrays may start at any number now (instead of 0), Encryption / Decryption of nodes has been included (in 0.05 I may add encryption / decryption of attributes, but that is not really needed...) I guess that is all, so as always, if you have any questions / comments / suggestions please feel free to contact me via email.
